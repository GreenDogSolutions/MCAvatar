Roadmap for updates/patches

@TODO
Enable queing of avatar creation.
Currently all of the users in "members.xml" are processed in one go.
When the list of users gets longer than a 100 users the script is running longer than the average time limit for php.
This occurs, in general, on servers with lesser resources and results in errors and even taking out the server.

@TODO
Add (SQL)database support
Instead of loading users from an xml, enable the user to enable database support and make MCAvatar get and store filepaths, users and settings from a (SQL)database.

@TODO
If database support is enabled, enable the script to cache the avatarpage into the database.
